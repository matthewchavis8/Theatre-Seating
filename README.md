# 🎭 Theatre Seat Reservation App 🎟️  

Welcome to the **Theatre Seat Reservation App**! This is a fun and collaborative semester project where we work together to build a seat reservation system for a local theatre using **.NET MAUI**.  

## ✨ Features  

✅ **Reserve a Seat** – Pick a seat and claim it if it's available!  
✅ **Reserve a Seat Range** – Book a row of seats (as long as they are free).  
✅ **Cancel Reservation** – Changed your mind? Free up a seat!  
✅ **Cancel Reservation Range** – Cancel multiple reservations at once.  
✅ **Reset Seating Chart** – Start fresh and clear all reservations.
